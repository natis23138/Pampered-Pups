          <h1>Testimonials</h1>
          <p>Seeing how happy their dogs are after visiting Pampered Pups, our cutomers are doing some tail wagging of their own! Here's what some have had to say:</p>

          <h4>Dee and Shane,</h4>
          <p>Angie wanted me to write and let you know how great she feels. Her hair is so smooth, and I no longer hear her toes scratching across my kitchen floor. Shane,  you have such a way with animals. Angie is usually hyper and jumpy, but your calm manner made this grooming visit unlike any other. Thanks for a wonderful first visit. We are already looking forward to next month.<br><i>Margaret C.</i></p>

          <h4>Dear Dee,</h4>
          <p>Thank you so much for keeping Patch safe and happy while I was away on business last week. I know he was happy to see me, but I could tell he had a great time at the "Fritz Ritz". I appreciate all that you and your employees did to make Patch;s stay so memorable.<br><i>Matt S.</i></p>

          <h4>Dearest Dee,</h4>
          <p>I'm writing on behalf of my owner, Ronnie. He hasn't stopped raving about what a great time I had at the plush "Fritz Ritz."If only he knew how much running around I made you do, he might worry that maybe I wouldn't be allowed back. But, it looked as if you had as much fun as I did. See you soon!<br><i>Sandra S.</i></p>
